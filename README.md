# Medicaid Managed Care Map

This interactive tool is under construction. It will map the coverage areas for the Medicaid managed care organizations through which some states operate their Medicaid insurance programs. The data source for this tool is the [2021 Managed Care Enrollment Data](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/managed-care/enrollment-report/index.html) publicly available on Medicaid.gov.
